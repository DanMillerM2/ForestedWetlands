# Forested Wetlands
This repository contains programs for building raster files of elevation derivatives along with python and R scripts for using those rasters to build and apply random forest models of wetland presence/absence in ArcGIS Pro. These methods were developed by Dan Miller at [TerrainWorks](http://www.terrainworks.com) and Meghan Halabisky at the University of Washington [Remote Sensing and Geospatial Analysis Lab](https://sites.uw.edu/rsgal/) as part of a wetland mapping project funded by the Cooperative Monitoring, Evaluation, and Research (CMER) Committee of the Washington Forest Practices Board and overseen by the Wetland Scientific Advisory Group (WetSAG). 

To use these tools with ArcGIS Pro, click on the download button to save the contents of this repository to your hard drive. The file Wetland_Tools_for_ArcGIS.pdf contains instructions for installing and running the tools.
